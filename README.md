First app ionic

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local system:

1. Node.js
2. Ionic CLI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Drago1204/ionic-app-university-practice.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the directory** of the cloned repository in your terminal.

3. **Install Node modules**:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs all the necessary Node modules as defined in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Ionic service**:
    ```
    ionic serve
    ```
    This command starts a local development server for app dev/testing.

Now, you should be able to see the application running in your web browser.
